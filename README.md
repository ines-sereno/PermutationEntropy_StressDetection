# Stress and Affect Detection Using Permutation Entropy

Analyzed chest-worn physiological signals (ECG, EDA, EMG, Respiration, Temperature) to detect mental states using complexity and entropy metrics.

## Features
- Sampled segments from the WESAD dataset (baseline, stress, amusement, meditation)
- Calculated Permutation Entropy and Complexity for each modality
- Visualized mental states via entropy-complexity scatter plots
- Detected clear trends between signal randomness and structured behavior

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Feature Engineering
- Time Series Signal Analysis
- Stress and Affect Detection

## Insights
- As randomness increases (entropy), signal structure (complexity) decreases
- Differentiated mental states based on physiological dynamics
